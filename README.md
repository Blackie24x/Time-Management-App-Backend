App which after logging in, allows you to create tasks, count the time of your focus and collect notes created by you.

To creating this app I were using such technologies as React, React Context to managing the state, React-Router, CSS modules, Express to allow the frontend to connect with backend and Mongoose to connect backend with MongoDB database.
